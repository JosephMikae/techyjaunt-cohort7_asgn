I mostly interact with web3 sites and applications, including
app.gib.work, engage.kgen.io, cypher.z1labs.ai and openet.org/portal,
among others.

I find Opnet to be particularly well-designed. As a web3 testnet web
application, it is extremely efficient because it has a section that
contains the utilities involved in its test run, allowing for easy
accessibility without needing to note or separately access the various
sites hosting these utilities.

There is also interoperability between the homepage and these 'various
sites,' whereby actions executed are sent and recorded on the homepage,
facilitating data exchange.

Finally, the user interface of the web application is designed through
an optimal use of CSS and JavaScript, evident in the harmonious use of
colors and diagrams, alongside the interactivity.

I am aware that this cohort is a step towards becoming a versatile
software engineer, and to attain this status, one must be capable of
designing interfaces that users can seamlessly navigate. Therefore, by
the end of this cohort, I anticipate using each skill and knowledge
acquired in building websites and web applications with utility. I am
also anticipating utilizing my code in other programming fields.

I am not particularly excited about a specific aspect of frontend
development. I am rather excited about it in its entirety, from the
light steps to the hefty ones; everything has me quivering with
expectations.

And yes, I'm nervous. I have many questions, such as, 'how do I
integrate these programming languages to obtain what the users require;
how do I spot and solve problems; how do I offer utility?'

It is not enough to acquire a skill; it is necessary to practice and
make it functional. I hope to utilize every single aspect of this cohort
in building something practicable and dependable.
